                           	Sven Faulconer was born in Belgium and started studying music at the age of 6. He quickly developed a taste for improvising on the piano and soon began writing his own pieces. Throughout the years, Sven became a passionate clarinet player and performed a number of clarinet solo concertos with symphonic orchestra.

                           <p>
                           	He managed to combine his passion for music with his engineering studies and spent his last year studying in Rome where he collaborated with a number of Italian directors. That was his introduction to the art of writing music for picture.

                           <p>
                           	Sven was so impressed by the potential synergy between music & film – as well as by the fulfillment which the film scoring process brought to him – that most of his work since then has been part of a collaborative story-telling effort.

                            	In 2007, he moved from Belgium to Los Angeles, a great opportunity to further develop his passion for film music. He wrote a variety of soundtracks and enrolled in the UCLA Certificate Program in Film Scoring, considered one of the top film scoring programs in the world. Since then, he has written soundtracks for several exciting projects. In 2009, he got hired as a music production assistant by Marc Streitenfeld, who at that time was composing the music for Ridley Scott’s feature film Robin Hood. After that, he was brought on as a Midi Orchestrator for 2 projects by Heitor Perreira at Hans Zimmer’s studio, Remote Control.

								In addition to working on his own projects, he currently assists James Newton Howard, the composer of movies like The Hunger Games, Snow White And The Huntsman, The Bourne Legacy, The Dark Knight, Water For Elephants, The Sixth Sense, I Am Legend, The Village and Devil’s Advocate.
