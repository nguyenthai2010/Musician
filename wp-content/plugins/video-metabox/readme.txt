Add video to your blog quickly and easily.

== Description ==

Video Metabox adds simple support for embedding video into your blog. Videos from YouTube and Vimeo can be added to posts or other content types quickly and easily, and will display above your post's content. The video resizes automatically, so it will always look great no matter the device your visitors are using.

Video Metabox takes the guess work out of adding a video to your blog. **All you have to do is paste the URL of the video you want to embed into the video metabox**, and the plugin will do the rest. Your videos will always fit in the width of the blog post, and will always look their best.

1. Install Video Metabox via the WordPress.org plugin directory

OR 

1. Unzip `video-metabox.1.2.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate `Video Metabox`  through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. Adding Video is a snap! Just paste the URL for the video into the video metabox in the admin screen
