Video Metabox
=============

Video Metabox is a WordPress plugin that adds simple support for embedding video into your blog. Videos from YouTube and Vimeo can be added to posts or other content types quickly and easily, and will display above your post's content. The video will resize automatically, so it will always look great no matter your device.

Video Metabox takes the guess work out of adding a video to your blog. All you have to do is paste the URL of the video you want to embed into the video metabox, and the plugin will do the rest. Your videos will always fit in the width of the blog post, and will always look their best.
